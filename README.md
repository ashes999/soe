**Note:** You can apply the following URL parameters:
- `?debug=true` prints out lots of additional logging/debugging information.
- `?universe=x` (where x is a non-negative integer) plays a specific game universe
(You can combine these parameters, like any URL parameters, with `&` instead of `?` for the second parameter.)

A procedural 2D action-RPG that creates random games like the major epics of our time. Made in Phaser.io with CoffeeScript.
